					<h3>Project Breakdown</h3>
				</header>
				<p>The aim of this project was to code a 7 degree of freedom robotic arm to play a fully automated game of chess. This was a team project in which I worked on the perception module. This involved sensing the locations of the chess pieces after each move in the game. OpenCv was used with a RBG-D Camera.</p>
        <p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/nebbles/DE3-ROB1-CHESS">Github repository</a> and the <a href="https://de3-rob1-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">documentation</a>.</p>
