	<div class="inner">
	<p>Children around the world are not openly talking about menstruation. Teachers and parents are not given the right tools to talk (and laugh) about what is happening to their bodies. On It aims to enable teachers, parents and children to be more open when talking about their bodies enabling them to be happier and healthier. This project won a Grey Pencil at the D&AD New Blood awards.</p>
