      <h3>Project Breakdown.</h3>
    </header>
    <p>I was part of a team to design a low cost wheelchair fencing frame for manufacture and use in low income countries to increase international accessibility to sport. This was completed with the funding and support of the <a href="http://www.iwasf.com/iwasf/"> International Wheelchair &amp; Amputee Sports Federation</a> as part of a research placement at Imperial College London.

			<h3>Insight.</h3>
		</header>

		<p>
		Due to the stigma associated with disability, those with disabilities in developing countries are often excluded from education, employment and the community inhibiting their social and mental development. Sport can be trans-formative but there are barriers regarding participation in developing countries due to the lack of physical education, lack of financing and lack of equipment.


		The design team spoke to wheelchair fencing teams globally and met with Dimitri Coutya, European Fencing Championships 2018 Bronze medalist, to establish the problems withe existing frames. These include costing over Â£2000 &amp; weighing in excess of 100kg. Two key benchmarks to achieve were to make the frame for under Â£200 and make it transportable.â€‹â€‹
