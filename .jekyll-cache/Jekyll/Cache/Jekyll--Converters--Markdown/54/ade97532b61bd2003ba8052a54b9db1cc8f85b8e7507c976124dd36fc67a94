      <h3>Project Breakdown</h3>
    </header>
    <p>The aim of this project was to code a 7 degree of freedom robotic arm to play a fully automated game of chess. This was a team project in which I worked on the perception module. This involved sensing the locations of the chess pieces after each move in the game. OpenCv was used with a RBG-D Camera.</p>
