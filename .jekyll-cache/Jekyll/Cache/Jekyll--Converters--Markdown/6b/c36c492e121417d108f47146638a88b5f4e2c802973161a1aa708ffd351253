					 For two weeks data was collected using the Spotify API and Dark Sky weather API on the music I listen to and the weather in London. A Raspbery Pi was used to call retrieve the data and then store it on a Google Sheet using the Sheets API.

					 A regression model was created to map the weather in London to the audio features of Spotify tracks. The data was split into 3:1 to train and test the model, with an achieved R squared of 0.5. The reliance of this model could be improved by collecting data over a longer period of time with a larger range of weather patterns.

					 An online portal was created where users can request a playlist recommendation based on their current location. This playlist can then be added to their account.
